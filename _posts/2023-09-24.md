It's been *A WHILE* since I've been able to say that I actually finished almost anything. That goes for software projects, work stuff, and woodworking. But over the weekend I finally finished something: I built anna a clothes drying hanger/rack to hang up in the laundry room for drying her clothes that can't be dried in the dryer. It wasn't that much *WORK* but it was hard for me in my current state. I had to:

- Cut plywood on the table saw
- Round the corners with the strip sander
- Roundover the edges on the router table (clamped onto the table saw for now, very low effort)
- Drill holes for the upper hooks (to hold the plastic chains) and lower hooks (to hold clips)
- Sand the surfaces with the random orbit sander
- Stain the plywood
- Seal the plywood with clear coat
- Sand the clearcoat smooth
- Install the upper and lower hooks
- Clamp the upper hooks shut around their chains
- Drill holes in the clips so they can go on the lower hooks

Overall it was maybe 5-10 hours of effort, but it took over a week of working on it a bit at a time, and the result looks decent so I'm pretty happy with it. More importantly Anna was thrilled with it and thought it was an amazing birthday present, and I think she appreciated it more because it's based on a common household item in Japan. I installed a hook in the ceiling of the laundry room which I'm sure anyone would find to be useful.
