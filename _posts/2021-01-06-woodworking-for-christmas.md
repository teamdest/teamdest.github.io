I got very interested in woodworking around june of last year, probably after the lockdown had started to set in a bit and I was pretty bored, but at the time I didn't really have the disposable income to work on anything. I'd already had a miter saw and some chisels and hammers and hand tools that I'd used here and there, but to really get into it I thought I'd need at least a circular saw and maybe a random orbit sander or something similar to that. I'd basically been putting off doing any kind of woodworking beyond just watching videos for months, and I thought I wouldn't have the opportunity to do anything until at least early spring.

But Christmas came and it turns out Anna knows me even better than I'd thought, and for christmas she got me a (Left-Handed!!!) electric circular saw, and her parents got me a saw guide for cutting plywood. At this point, the only thing I'm really waiting on is some kind of sander, and I think we might have a semi-working one in the garage somewhere, that I could press into service at least temporarily.

So with those things suddenly available, I think I'm going to look at making a rolling workbench and a sewing machine table for Bill's antique sewing machine. Both of those feel like good "basic" projects that I can probably find a lot of research already done on, and maybe plans that I just have to follow. Definitely feels like sanding and edge routing are going to be the sticking points there, hopefully I can sort it all out.

As far as the Ramps go, I think I've got a good plan for those, but I need to do some more detailed modeling on that, and then I'll make a separate post for it.
