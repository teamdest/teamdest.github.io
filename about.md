I'm a professional systems administrator, part time programmer, and amateur dabbler in various hobbies that I sometimes pretend to be good at. Among those hobbies are (recently) woodworking, electronics design, lockpicking, and occasionally upgrading my old Audi. 


### More Information

Every year, I and some friends take part in Extra Life, a 24-hour charity gaming marathon in support of the Children's Miracle Network hospitals. Donations I receive go towards Children's Specialized Hospital here in NJ, which is a really great place that makes a huge difference in a lot of kid's lives. This marathon usually takes place in early November, though we've been discussing starting up a summer counterpart.
